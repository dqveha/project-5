## Project Description

This is the fifth independent project assigned by Epicodus to assess the use of Jest, and working within environments. The purpose of the web application is to let the user input their date of birth, and have it output their age in Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter years. In addition, it will provide a life expectancy that will either show the user how much life expectancy they have left, or how many years they passed the average life expectancy.

Additional features added from author:

- Requirement of an entered date before showing results
- Disabling user to input future date
- Happy Earth-Birthday alert
- Reset button
